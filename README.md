# Ignite UI for Angular (DockManager, Grids, Charts...) + Reveal Dashboard

It's something that puts the Reveal and Ignite UI (for Angular) Grids and Charts as panes in DockManager, and they work together.
When you click on specific data in the Reveal dashboard, Grid and Chart in another pane will work together to display the data.
